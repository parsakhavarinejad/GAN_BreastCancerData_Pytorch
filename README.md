# Breast Cancer GAN using PyTorch

This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implementation for generating synthetic breast cancer images using PyTorch. The GAN is trained on a dataset of breast cancer images.

## Features

- **PyTorch Implementation:** Utilizes the power of PyTorch for efficient deep learning model development.
- **GAN Architecture:** Implements a Generative Adversarial Network with both generator and discriminator components.
- **Breast Cancer Image Synthesis:** Generates synthetic breast cancer images to augment existing datasets.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure your breast cancer image dataset is appropriately organized.
2. **Training:** Run the entire notebook to train the GAN on the dataset.
3. **Inference:** Generate synthetic images using the trained GAN model.

Feel free to explore and contribute to further advancements in synthetic image generation for breast cancer research.

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- The dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset)

## Acknowledgments

This work is inspired by the potential of GANs in medical image synthesis and contributes to the ongoing efforts in breast cancer research.
